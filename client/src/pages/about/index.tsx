    united states that introduce the holy land gifts and crafts that are
    mainly found or made in the holy land. Its main focus and product is
    the jewelry that is made with ancient roman glass.
    this idea has been introduced to the market as a unique idea of
    jewelry that is found in the hills of Samaria is a biblical site in
    the heart of the holy land.<br></br>
    The original store that dealt with this kind of item is also in Samaria as
    a gift shop located next to Herod's the great’s palace. The
    the original store was found in the early 1970s then it expanded to be a
    gift shop, and a restaurant where diverse tourism visitors come to it
    from all over the world
    the founder of the store was a history teacher "Mr. Adel Ghazal” who
    was very into ancient roman antiques.<br></br>
    The roman glass gained its importance since it goes back to the time
    of Herod the Great and Jesus time. therefore we designed the jewelry
    with roman glass to be even more valuable.</p>
